<h2>üí∞ Cost Estimation</h2>

Calculation: 
Tentative price token from google AI for Developers Input: $0.075, prompts <= 128k tokens, output: $0.30, prompts <= 128k tokens
 (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing)
<em>Note: Paid Tier, per 1M tokens in USD</em>

A 1 million would not be appopratie for a company so lets begin our calculation for 1 invoice. 

<p>
Lets say a large size image takes 800 tokens: <br>
Tokens = 800 <br>
Input price: $0.075 <br>
Output price: $0.30 <br> 

So based on given data; <br>
Total price for input  = 800/10,00,000*0.075<br> 
			= 0.00006 <br>
Total price for output = 800/10,00,000*0.30 <br>
			= 0.00024 <br> 

**Total price for one invoice** = 0.0006+0.00024  <br>
				= 0.0003
